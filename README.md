Basic Calculator

This project helped me solidify the DOM manipulation skills previously taught.
It also helped me greatly improve my git skills, as branches made adding new
features fell safe. I enjoyed the fact that while working on new features, I 
could still see the current working version via the main branch. I also had a
few times where I had to roll back a commit, which that option is amazing.

I struggled to update the screen with the calculated result, but it felt 
amazing to overcome that. 

I also struggled with the responsiveness, but I
looked into grid, and also stumbled into the CSS feature, clamp(). These new
found techniques along with flex really helped.

Adding keyboard support was less of a challenge then it appeared to be, as the
event handling skills I learned at the beginning of the project really paid off.
