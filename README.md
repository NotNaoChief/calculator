Basic Calculator

This project helped me solidify the DOM manipulation skills previously taught.

I struggled to update the screen with the calculated result, but it felt 
amazing to overcome that. 

I also struggled with the responsiveness, but I
looked into grid, and also stumbled into the CSS feature, clamp(). These new
found techniques along with flex really helped.

Adding keyboard support was less of a challenge then it appeared to be, as the
event handling skills I learned at the beginning of the project really paid off.
